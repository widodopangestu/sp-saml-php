Take care of this folder that could contain private key. Be sure that this folder never is published.

PHP Toolkit expects certs for the SP stored at:

 * sp.key   Private Key
 * sp.crt  Public cert
 * sp_new.crt Future Public cert

Also you can use other cert to sign the metadata of the SP using the:

 * metadata.key
 * metadata.crt


Creating Private Key and Certificates
=====================================

Generate the SP files with the following command:
- `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -nodes -days 900`
